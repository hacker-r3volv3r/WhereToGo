# Where To Go with leaked account in the corporate environment.
Due to security assessments of different projects, I found different leaked/exposed accounts on the domain of the organization. But every time it was so difficult to discover the place where I can reuse those credentials and how can I expand my attack surface. 
This project should help researchers, pentesters, bounty-hunters to expand the risks of compromised accounts in the corporate environment.
 
 
 
# Story behind WhereToGo project
> Due Penetration testing activities for one customer it was discovered leaked employee credentials. First of all thouse crdentials were checked on the corporate environment but later on I realized that such credentials could work on other important cloud services. I started collecting such a list of popular technological services which might have high value in case of improper access.
