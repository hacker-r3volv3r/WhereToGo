# WhereToGo

Due to security assessments of different projects, I found different leaked/exposed accounts on the domain of the organization. But every time it was so difficult to discover the place where I can reuse those credentials and how can I expand my attack surface. 
This project should help researchers/ pentesters /bounty-hunters to expand the risks of compromised accounts in the corporate environment.
